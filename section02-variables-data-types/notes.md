# php variables and data types
- php can be used to quickly spin up a view without requiering any other technology/setup
  - this is neat, compared to the legwork required to spin up a react app, for example
- php tags are hidden from the browser (which are rendered server side) before the browser serves the content
- 

## VARIABLE RULES:
- All variables are prefixed with a dollar sign ($).
- They must start with a letter or an underscore.
- They cannot start with a number.
- They can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- They are case sensitive. So, `$name` and `$Name` are two different variables.

## php data types
- loosely typed, variable types can change on the fly

## php misc
- sometimes php bugs out on the browser, users are forced to close the tab & navigate to URL to get code to work
- php re-runs once the browser is refreshed
- sometimes VS code does not refresh errors until the php file is saved
